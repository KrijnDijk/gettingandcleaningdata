# Codebook for Samsung data
##  Coursera "Getting and cleaning data" programming assignment

### Data modification

Original data was downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

These data were modified by performing the steps below, described in more detail in the Readme.MD file.

1. Test and training datasets ("X_test.txt" and "X_train.txt") were merged. This creates a data frame with each row corresponding to a unique subject/activity/time point combination. Each column corresponds to the value of a particular feature measured (see below)

2. This dataset was subsetted to create a selection that only retains features measuring the mean or standard deviation. 

3. Two additional columns were added to the dataset. One describes the activity performed. The numerical variable corresponding to activities in the original datasets was replaced by descriptive variable names. The second column indicates the subject ID.

4. All variables were labled with descriptive names.

5. This data table is saved as "alldata.txt"

6. Finally, a second table was generated that reports the average data for each feature, for each activity/subject combination (rather than the data for individual time points). This data table is saved as "tidydata.txt"

### Variable names
This reports variable (column) names for the first two columns, what they refer to, and the values that this variable can take.

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
  
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
  
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).  
  
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.  
  
tBodyAcc-XYZ  
tGravityAcc-XYZ  
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ  
tBodyGyro-XYZ  
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ  
tBodyAccMag   
tGravityAccMag  
tBodyAccJerkMag  
tBodyGyroMag  
tBodyGyroJerkMag  
fBodyAcc-XYZ  
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ  
fBodyGyro-XYZ  
fBodyAccMag  
fBodyAccJerkMag  
fBodyGyroMag  
fBodyGyroJerkMag  
  
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:  
  
mean(): Mean value  
std(): Standard deviation  
  
These variables were computed for each of the futures described above, separated per axis (X, Y, or Z). This retains the following variables:

tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
